## Overview

This project is a **FastAPI-based web application** developed as part of the **Techbleat DevOps MasterClass – Capstone Project II**.

The application provides a simple authentication flow with a login page and a protected dashboard. It is intentionally lightweight and designed to be deployed in a **secure AWS IaaS environment** as part of a DevOps capstone, integrating Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, OS hardening, and configuration management.

After successful login, the user is redirected to a welcome page confirming authenticated access.

## DevOps Capstone Context

This application is designed to be used as part of a **secure DevOps capstone project**, where students will:

- Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform
- Deploy the app on hardened EC2 instances in private subnets
- Place the app behind an HTTPS Application Load Balancer
- Use Ansible for OS hardening and application deployment
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with:
